# coq-bonsai
> ðŸŒ³ Generate a random bonsai in your terminal

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarus/coq-bonsai/master/screenshot.png)

Inspired by [bonsai.sh](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh). Written in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

Add the Coq's [opam repository](https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive):
```sh
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
```

Install:
```sh
opam install coq-bonsai
```

Run:
```sh
coq-bonsai
```

You can add it to your terminal's startup file (like `~/.bashrc`) so that you always start your terminal sessions with a fresh bonsai.
